In this paper, we consider an active vibration control system based on a simple adaptive control (SAC) method when the system is subjected to bounded disturbances. The SAC method has advantages such that it requires little knowledge with respect to information about disturbances and plant-order when we construct a control system. However, the method was proposed only for tracking control problems. Hence, we first modified the usual SAC techniques to regulator control methods. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for the vibration control problems were confirmed by the experimental results obtained from the laboratory-scale experimental equipment of active vibration control. That is, the fundamental vibration suppression characteristics, such as robustness for the nonlinear friction and random disturbances, were attained by use of the modified SAC algorithm.
