In this paper an experimental study of the impact response of a physical human head-neck model is described. The midoccipital region of the model was hit by steel block impacter, then the intracranial pressure of frontal region and the acceleration of the head were measured. The intracranial pressure curve showed a sharp negative pulse. The peak of intracraial pressure pulse appeared right after the peak of acceleration pulse and the difference was 0.8 msec. The influence of the rigidity, the speed and the shape of the steel block on the intracranial pressure and the acceleration was investigated.
