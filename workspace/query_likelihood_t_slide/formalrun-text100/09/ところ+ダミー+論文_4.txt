音楽ホール等の竣工前室内音響模型実験において,聴取者の両耳位置での収音には模型と同縮尺のダミーヘッドが使用されるが,通常頭部は耳介のない剛球である.本稿では,耳介も含めた1/10縮尺模型実験用のダミーヘッドを光造型法で試作した.精密耳介あり,耳介なし剛球頭部,および原寸の頭部伝達関数を測定し比較した結果,試作した耳介あり高精度ダミーヘッドは,原寸のダミーヘッドの特徴を良く表現できていることが確認された.
In an acoustical small-scale experiment of a music hall before completion, a same scale dummy-head microphone is often used to record impluse responses. However, the head shape is normally represented by a rigid sphere without ears. In this report, a tenth-scale dummy-head microphone with high-precision ears is developed by use of stereolithography. Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) of the developed and conventional dummy-heads were measured and compared. As a result, it was confirmed that main features of the HRTFs of the developed dummy-head were similar those of the original dummy-head.
