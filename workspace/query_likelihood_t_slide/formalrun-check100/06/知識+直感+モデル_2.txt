An experienced process engineer immediately judges in incredibly short time regardless of the complexity of contents described in a given part drawing in case of actual operation. According to our investigation performed previously, this is because the engineer is carrying out the process planning of flair-based type, in which a diagram image of a part drawing is used preferably with employing the top down-like procedure. Then our former paper suggested a general concept of CAPP system of flair-based type. In this paper, a method of knowledge process is proposed by the structural matching technique based on the imitation of model patterns of process plan-examples, and applied this method applies to the simple case of the process planning problem.
