A theoretical study of the phenomenon for deck wetness is presented. And the optimum flare angle is discussed. It is shown that the 2-dimensional self-similar flow is aplicable to the analysis of deck wetness on the assumption of the long wave length and high Froude number. The 2-dimensional self-similar flow which includs effects of the deck is caluculated by the analytical method. Calculated results are compared with experimental ones which are obtained at the limit of long wave length, i.e., in still water. Using calculated results, the optimum flare angle is discussed. And an attempt to determine the Optimum flare angle is presented.
