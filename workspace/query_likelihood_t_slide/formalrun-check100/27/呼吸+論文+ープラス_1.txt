Many adult water beetles and adult water bugs hold the bubble or layer of air in unwettable hairs or under the wings for under water respiration. Such a respiration system is called plastron respiration. It was suggested that a respiration blocking is caused by treatment of surfactants for aquatic insects that does plastron respiration. So, the acute influence test of surfactants was done by using three species of water bugs and two species of elmid beetles with plastron respiration. As a result, it was found that the aquatic insects with plastron respiration were more influenced by treatment of surfactants than <I>Daphnia magna</I>, and the sensitivity of surfactants was especially high in elmid beetles.
