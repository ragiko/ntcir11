ABSTRACT Two experiments were carried out to compare the effectiveness among three types of elaborations(a self-generated elaboration, a self-choice elaboration, and an experimenterprovided elaboration)in incidental memory of words. In a self-generated elaboration condition the subjects were asked to generate a associate in Exp. 1 and two associates in Exp. 2 from each target. In a self-choice elaboration condition, they were asked to choose one of the two words (both words were associates of targets in a difficult self-choice elaboration condition, one word was associate of target and the other was non-associate in easy self-choice elaboration condition) which has stronger association to each target. And in an experimenter-provided elaboration condition the subjects were required to rate the strength of association between a presented word and each target. Self-generated elaboration and difficult self-choice elaboration led to a better free recall than easy self-choice elaboration, that in turn led to better recall than an experimenter-provided elaboration in Exp. 1. Self-generated elaboration led to a better free recall than the other elaborations in Exp. 2. These results were interpreted as showing that the effectiveness of a self-choice elaboration was determined by the difficulty of choosing, and that the effectiveness of a self-generated elaboration was determined by the quantity of generated information.
