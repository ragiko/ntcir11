The long tokamak operation of more than 1 hour has been demonstrated in the superconducting high field tokamak TRIAM - 1M. The 1 hour discharges with a plasma current of 22kA and a line averaged density of 2 x 10^<18>m^<-3> were maintained by 2.45GHz RF power (P_<RF> < 50kW) alone. In order to maintain the long duration discharges, the following technical issues have been developed: the density control, the position control, the power handling and the data acquisition. Hard X-ray emission profiles indicate that the high energy electrons that carried the plasma current were concentrated in the inner region of the plasma column. The hydrogen recycling ratio approached 1 with the time constant of about 8 sec and afterward the steady particle balance was kept for 1 hour till the RF power was turned off. High density (<n_e>^^^- 〜 2 x 10^<19>m^<-3>) and long duration (〜 23sec) discharges were also obtained by 8.2GHz RF power (P_<RF> < 200kW) alone.
