In summary, this is a well-written text that treats the key classical models of finance through an applied probability approach. It is accessible to a broad audience and has been developed after years of teaching the subject. It should serve as an excellent introduction for anyone studying the mathematics of the classical theory of finance.   -- SIAM, 2005   It is a must for anybody who wants to get into mathematical finance and a pleasure for experts to see that the mathematical finance can be well communicated, made easy and rigorous at the same time.  --www.mathfinance.de, 2004   The contents of the book have been used successfully with students whose mathematics background consists of calculus and calculus-based probability. The text gives both precise statements of results, plausibility arguments, and even some proofs. But more importantly, intuitive explanations, developed and refine through classroom experience with this material are provided throughout the book.   --Finanz Betrieb, Vol. 7 (5), 2005
