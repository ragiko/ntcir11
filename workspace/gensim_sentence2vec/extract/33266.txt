ABSTRACT This paper proposes a Dirichlet process mixture modeling approach to Dirichlet Mixtures (DM). Endowing a prior distribution on an infinite number of mixture components, this approach yields an appropriate number of components as well as their parameters at the same time. Experimental results on amino acid distributions and text corpora confirmed this eect
