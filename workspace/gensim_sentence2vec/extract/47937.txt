FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST:

iii.	3 LOCAL SECURITY MEN AT THE GATE OF SHOLAPE OWORU STREET, OKOTA
OVER
(A). USURPATION OF JUDICIAL POWERS (B). ABUSE OF POWER (C). CRIMINAL ACTS (D).  RESORT TO SELF – HELP
I Mr. Olujimi Ogunlalu hereby lodge formal complaint against the D.P.O Ago Police Station, my landlord Alhaji Wale Monsuro and the three local security men manning the gate at Sholape Oworu Street, off Marcity Bus stop, via Ago Palace Way, Okota.
A.	RESTRICTION OF MY MOVEMENT AND DENYING ME ACCESS TO MY PROPERTY
On Tuesday 27th August, 2013, I lodged a formal complaint at Ago, Okota Police Station against my landlord Alhaji Wale Monsuro and the 3 Local security men for not allowing me take two beds, a water dispenser, my kids wardrobe and some other items which I wanted to take to where my kids are living with my relative thereby criminally restricting my right to freedom of movement which can lead to breach of peace.
CIVIL SUIT FOR REPOSSESSION OF APARTMENT
Since 2011 Alhaji Wale Monsuro and I have been in court in suit NO/MCY/6877/2010 at Ejigbo magistrate court for repossession of apartment (Appendix 1 Plaintiffs Writ of possession refers please) on Thursday July 18, 2013 he filed a notice of discontinuance through his lawyer (Appendix 2 Notice of discontinuance refers please).
ALLEGATION OF OWING RENT AND PERPETRATING CRIMINAL ACT
Alhaji Monsuro alleged an owing him a rent and therefore cannot take anything out of the house for repairs or for anything.
i.	By this he is taking the laws into his hands especially when the case of repossession should be decided by the court.
ii.	It is pertinent to mention that it is a judicial court that can decide whether I am owing or not. It is the court that will decide whether am a tenant at will or a statutory tenant.
iii.	It is also a known fact in law that if I lose the case the court will compel me to pay all arrears of rent, if it deems it fit.
iv.	It is a known fact in law that in seeking recovery, if any, of any arrears of rent you approach the court through a civil suit.
THE D.P.O. AGO OKOTA
I told the D.P.O it is a criminal act for Alhaji Monsuro to stop me from taking some of my items but what did he say? He said You too go and pay him what you owe him. The D.P.O is thereby encouraging violence and criminality. Thus Alhaji Monsuro is using the D.P.O to restrict my movement and encouraging him on acts bordering on criminal breach of public peace. He is therefore usurping the judicial powers of the court.
POINT OF LAW ON RECOVERING ALLEGED ARREARS OF RENT 
I want to point out that it is the court that will decide whether I am owing or not and it is the court that can compel me to pay if am owing not the D.P.O or Alhaji Monsuro or the 3 security gatemen.
In Know your rights against the police and in court in criminal matters by Barrister Tunde Akinsola ISBN – 978 – 978 – 904 – 209 – 8 2010 edition attached herewith, pages 56 – 57 (Appendix 3) under Landlord/Tenant matters. 
i.	Chapter 8 (Categories of cases the police handled) chapter 8 (B) he said that The police cannot dabble into any tenancy matters. It does not matter whether the tenant is in arrears for 20 years or whether he has vacated and locked up the apartment for 10 years that the police cannot be used to recover arrears owed by the tenant.  In this case the D.P.O is being used to perpetuate illegality and criminal acts.
ii.	Chapter 8 (B) last paragraph says The police can however interfere in a Landlord and tenant dispute where for instance; the Landlord and the tenant or their families engage in fight against each other or threaten each other. This is a CRIME WHICH THE POLICE ARE EMPOWERED TO INVESTIGATE in this case the D.P.O has deliberately refused to stop the lawlessness and criminality of Alhaji Monsuro 
iii.	Chapter 8 (B) paragraph 3 also stated that Any policeman who indulges in dabbling into tenancy matters would have himself to blame when the matter gets to his superiors.
B.	CRIMINALLY LOCKING ME OUT OF MY APARTMENT
After I went out after returning the items I wanted to take out Alhaji Monsuro had locked the door to the staircase that led to my flat thereby denying me access to enter my apartment between the night of Tuesday August 27, 2013 and Friday September 6, 2013thereby not allowing me access to my apartment  which is criminal and a resort to self help in ejecting me.
C.	UNLAWFULLY AND CRIMINALLY USING AN OLD KING SIZE FRIDGE TO BLOCK THE ENTRANCE TO MY STAIRCASE
In the evening of Friday September 6, 2013 the door leading to the staircase was opened but Alhaji Monsuro had used one of his used king size fridge to block the entrance to my staircase that leads to my apartment. I took it out Alhaja Monsuro the wife to Alhaji Monsuro that Friday September 6, 2013 said you cant take it out, leave it where it is and she started to fight me.
Note: I want to mention in passing that the entrance to the staircase and under the staircase is meant for me but he deliberately put junks there to harass me. 
ALL THESE ARE CRIMINAL ACTS BEING PERPETRATED BY ALHAJI MONSURO BECAUSE THE D.P.O LEFT HIM UNTOUCHED. HE IS ABOVE THE LAW
I HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE IN THE D.P.O AGO OKOTA
Before Tuesday 27th August 2013, I have reported Alhaji Monsuro to the D.P.O on criminal acts which he deliberately refused to investigate or prosecute.
a.	In a petition titled Formal complaints against criminal acts by Alhaji Wale Monsuro dated 15th April, 2013 and addressed to the D.P.O Ago Okota and submitted on the 16th of April, 2013, (Appendix 4 refers please)  I complained that;
i.	Alhaji Monsuro deliberately locked me out at about 9:00pm on Sunday April 14, 2013, Friday, April 5, 2013 and other days with my small kids aged 10, 8 and 6 years left all alone in the house. I want to mention that these criminal acts were incidented at the counter at the Ago Police Station.
ii.	On 12th of March 2013 he locks the gate and didnt allow me to take my big fridge and freezer out for repairs.
iii.	On Saturday April 13, 2013 at about 9:00pm he brought thugs to attack me who almost brought down my door.
iv.	He locks the gate for the entry of vehicles and pedestrians, he refuses to give me the key.
b.	In a petition dated 17th August 2012 titled Deliberate action that can lead to breach of peace (Appendix 5 refers please).
i.	I complained that since June 7, 2012 Alhaji Monsuro deliberately refused to pump water into my flat up till the present moment, thereby resorting to self help to eject me.
ii.	That he cut off my light without the authority and consent of PHCN for 5 months. It was the officials of PHCN that later reconnected the light after series of letters of petition.
Note: In these two petitions the D.P.O refused to act or investigate, is Alhaji Monsuro above the law?
HOSTILITY OF THE D.P.O (Inspector General of Police and Chairman Police Service Commission Please Note)  
i.	The D.P.O is extremely hostile to me because corporal Omilabu of Ago Okota Police Station told him I have written letters of complaint against him to the higher authorities. (The letters of complaints are being attached to a separate letter to the Police Service Commission). 
ii.	The D.P.O is extremely hostile to me all the time for reasons best known to him. The D.P.O has exhibited lack of the knowledge of existing and extant laws, bias, and favouritism. 
iii.	He has shown bias which may have largely or probably been based on financial inducement, why does he have such venomous hostility towards me? Now how do you maintain law and order when a D.P.O encourages lawlessness and criminality. I am calling on the Inspector General of Police and then Chairman Police Service Commission to look and examine the conduct of the D.P.O to all complaints I reported to him and his office and his deliberate action not to investigate nor prosecute.  
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF A POLICE OFFICER 
In the code of conduct and professional standards for police officers; the primary responsibility of a police officer is safe guarding lives and properties, protecting the innocent, keeping the peace and ensuring the rights of all to liberty, equality and justice.
PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES OF A POLICE OFFICER
1.	A police officer shall perform all duties impartially, without fear or favour, or affection or ill will and without regard to status, sex, race, religion, political belief or aspiration.
2.	All citizens will be treated equally with courtesy, consideration and dignity.
3.	Officers will never allow personal feelings, animosities or friendships to influence official conduct.
4.	Laws should be enforced appropriately. 
With the greatest respects, the D.P.O Ago Okota has violated the code of conduct of the police. I am calling upon the Inspector General of Police and the Police Service Commission to examine his conduct vis a viz the Police Code of Conduct   
Attention the press, Nigerian Bar Association (N.B.A), Human Rights Activists and Civil Society Groups and Diplomats.
I want the Press, all Human Rights activists and civil society groups, Diplomats and all whom this letter is being forwarded to and another separate special letter to note that if any thing happens to me or my family in the future they should know whom to hold responsible.
Thank you.
PRAYERS
1.	I am requesting that the authorities examine my allegations against the D.P.O Ago Okota.
2.	That Alhaji Monsuro be arrested and investigated and prosecuted along with the 3 local security men for violating my rights to movement and denying me access to my property.
3.	That Alhaji Monsuro be arrested and prosecuted for locking me out of my apartment without the order of the court.
4.	Be arrested and investigated for forcefully putting the long fridge on the entry to my staircase in order to stop me from entering my apartment and
5.	Investigate all previous criminal allegations against Alhaji Wale Monsuro, his wife Alhaja Monsuro and his two sons Bolaji and Folusho Monsuro.
Note: I want to be emphatic here that Alhaji Wale Monsuro has been boasting that his lawyer Barrister Gbenga Olugbake knows the top hierarchy in the Police Force that is why all criminal acts against him reported since 2010 are being swept under the carpet. But I want the whole world to know that I will not rest until I get justice, I believe in justice and the course of justice. I am not lawless nor do I perpetrate criminal acts nor resort to self help. I have always believed in using the instrumentality of the law to fight wrongs meted out to me.     
Thank you.
