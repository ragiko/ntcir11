In a previous study, to minimize or eliminate the errors and noises associated with a full-field experimental measurement and subsequent fringe analysis such as moire interferomery, the authors have derived a variational principle minimizing the experimental measurement errors. Concepts of restoration forces and energies were also presented. Furthermore, the authors have developed an intelligent hybrid method based on this variational principle. In this study, first, a fringe-analysis method is developed together with the two-dimensional FFT. Then, experimentally recorded moire fringe patterns are analyzed by the fringe-analysis method. The conventional and present intelligent hybrid analyses are caried out using the analyzed fringe information as input data. The present method verifies the automatic detection of experimental noises and errors, and the simultaneous automatic elimination of those errors. This method also made it possible to obtain fairly smooth visualization of higher-order information such as the stress and strain distributions.
