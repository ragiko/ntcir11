Sorry to bother you so often. I forgot to mention one thing in my previous email. I attached a copy of my credit card for identification purpose. I blacked out the card numbers except for the last four digits. If you need anything else, please let me know. I'd like the item to be shipped out today if it's all possible. Thanks in advance for your kind arrangements.
