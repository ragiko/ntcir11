In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of 3D measurement and to develop the correctable machining system, a deviation detection type on-the-machine measuring system has been studied in this paper, which employs a 3D displacement detecting probe. After calibrating the measuring probe according to the obtained compensating coefficient, the ring gauge with very high accuracy and machined cam plate were measured. As the results, it was found that the measuring accuracy of this system was within 2 Î¼m in whole, and the measuring errors were originated from thermal deformation of the machine caused by ambient temperature and calibration errors.
