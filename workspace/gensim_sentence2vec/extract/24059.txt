ABSTRACT The aim of the research group is to obtain a general perspective of prosody for further understanding of speech recognition and synthesis. The group consists of researchers in the fields of speech engineering, cognitive sciences, socio-linguistics, brain sciences and phonology. Themes of the group are 1) Variability of prosody and its possible factors, 2) Individuality of prosody, 3) Locality and sociality of prosody, 4) Prosody of emotional speech, 5) Perception of degraded speech having little spectral information and 6) Word accent in words of Japanese origin. Obtained are classification of factors of variability in prosody, prosodic differences attributed to speakers' living areas, belonging societies, emotions and speaking environments, neural mechanisms of perceiving prosody and statistical dispositions of accent in bi-mora words of Japanese origin for both Tokyo dialect and Kyoto dialect. Collaboration is going on among the group members on neuronal studies of singing voices using MRI.
