ABSTRACT We had a lot of discussion about prosodic feature of Japanese such as mora timing language, syllable timing language or bimoraic foot. And some research reveal mora works as the smallest temporal unit of speech and psychological existence in Finnish. In this paper I compared both languages by "syllable weigh" which divides all the syllables into three, light syllable, heavy syllable and super heavy syllable which has sequence of two specific mora such as long vowel, double vowel, geminates etc. Finnish has super heavy syllables in noun and proper noun etc. but Japanese has super heavy syllables in onomatopoeia, foreign lown word, complex word but not in noun. In a word both languages have specific moras in one word, especially Chinese compound word in Japanese sometimes has a few specific moras. but Japanese does not have sequence of specific mora in super heavy syllable which Finnish has in the same circumstance. This paper reveals super heavy syllable which has sequence of specific moras is much more common in Finnish syllable structure than in Japanese.
