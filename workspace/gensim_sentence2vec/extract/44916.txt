The nonlinear time series analysis of two-phase flow is difficult, and the analysis sometimes results subjectively. Using artificially generated quasiperiodic data and submerged nozzle pressure fluctuation, we showed that applying an optimal delay time reconstruction method and a point correlation dimension method together greatly improved the reliability of the analysis. In this paper, we analyze real two-phase flows time series: differential pressure and void fraction of slug and bubbly flow in a vertical pipe. The comparisons of estimated results and their statistical test results demonstrate the high reliability of the proposed analysis method.
