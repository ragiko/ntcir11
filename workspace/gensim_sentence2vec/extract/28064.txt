本稿では, 発話の継続/終了に関与する情報として, 発話断片末の語彙, ピッチパターン, パワーパターンに着目して, その相関を調ぺた. この分析を利用し, 発話断片末の語彙, ピッチパターン, パワーパターンの出現確率を線型結合することによって, 発話の継続/終了を予測するモデルを提案した. 出現確率の分析に用いた対話データと同一のデータを対象に評価を行ったところ, 発話の継続では96.2%を, 発話の終了では96%の推定精度が得られた.
It has been suggested in the literature that there are some determinant elements which are either grammatical, lexical, prosodic or paralinguistic that signal which the speaker of an utterance fragment intends to be the speaker of the next utterance fragment, herself or the interlocuter. In this study, we singled out a set of relevant 3 factors that are jointly determinant of the intended speakership or the next utterance fragment. They are lexical (P0S) and prosodic (pitch and power level). Certain lexical types such as sentence-final particles and intensifiers, are effectively determinant of who speaks next. Others are not. But prosody and power are considered to significantly contribute to the determination. We have been able to model the method the speaker signals how she controls her discourse, viz. to terminate or to continue. The proposed model is a weighted and normalized sum of the 3 factors as analyzed above. The model fits the corpus of 3 minutes map task dialogue in Japanese at the rate of 96.2% in the case of continuation and 92.9% in the case of termination. The rest can be explained to some extent but also suggest the limitations of the model.
