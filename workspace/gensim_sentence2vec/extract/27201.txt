It is necessary to treat an earthquake motion which excites structures as a random process because it cannot be predicted in the form of deterministic time-function at present. This paper presents a probabilistic method for estimating nonlinear response of hysteretic structures under random excitation. The main parts of this theoretical method are that the response is represented by discrete states on the Force-Displacement plane and that a transition of the state is assumed to be simple Markov Chain. This method has the advantage of calculating probability of maximum response and first excursion failure easily. The theory is applied to a one mass elasto-plastic system subjected to a stationary Gaussian white noise. The theoretical result is compared with that of Monte Carlo simulations. These results show good agreements.
