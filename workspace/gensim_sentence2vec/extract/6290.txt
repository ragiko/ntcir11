Vibrotactile displays are expected to be effective tools for presenting personal information. When designing a vibrotactile information display, it is important to present correct, stable stimulation. However, the mechanical stability of the vibration is affected by many conditions such as how the vibrators are attached to the person, where they are attached, as well as other factors. In order to maintain the target frequency and amplitude of the vibration independent of the affective factors, we propose a feedback method for vibrotactile displays. Then, we did a subjective experiment by using this feedback system. We found that the feedback gave some change to the sensation of most of the subjects.
