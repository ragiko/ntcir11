Use this tool to check the Query Plan for any SOQL queries that execute slowly. It will provide you with insight on the different plans and should you have some of the filters indexed, provide the cost of using the index compared to a full table scan. If the cost for the table scan is lower than the index, and the query is timing out, you will need to perform further analysis on using other filters to improve selectivity, or, if you have another selective filter in that query that is not indexed but is a candidate for one.	Note: we declare a filter to be 'selective' if that filter returns <30% of the total row count for a standard indexed field, or <10% for a custom indexed field, where the total row count is inclusive of archived and soft-deleted rows.
