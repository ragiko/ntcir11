This paper presents the three-dimensional finite element formulation for calculating aerodynamic forces acting on oscillating linear cascade blades in a subsonic flow. Under the assumption of the potential flow, the velocity potentials at nodes are determined as the solution for the simultaneous algebraic equations. The expressions of acoustic and wake potentials are also given and used to determine upstream and downstream boundary conditions. The present formulation is applied successfully to a couple of three-dimensional geometries in the accompanying paper.
