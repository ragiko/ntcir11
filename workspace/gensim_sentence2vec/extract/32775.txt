As for the stock of bags which you offered me this time, I am not interested so much because I cannot find models I am looking for. As for shoes, I am interested in the brands, but I am not so confident if I can sell it successfully. It is regretful, but this time I will not place an order.I will consider to buy some boots for next season if mutual conditions meet, though I cannot be able to place an order immediately.
