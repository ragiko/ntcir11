ABSTRACT This paper proposes a novel unsupervised morphological analyzer of arbitrary language that does not need any supervised segmentation nor dictionary. Assuming a string as the output from a nonpara- metric Bayesian hierarchical n-gram language model of words and characters, "words" are iteratively estimated during inference by a combination of MCMC and an efficient dynamic programming. This model can also be considered as a method to learn an accurate n-gram language model directly from characters without any "word" information.
