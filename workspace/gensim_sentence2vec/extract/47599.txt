ABSTRACT The purpose of this study is to automatically structure sports live speech, especially baseball live speech using Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition system. Structures are useful for information retrieval, summarization and contents recommendation. In this paper, we propose the situ- ation dependent speech recognition which is the speech recognition method of incorporating the baseball dependent knowledge. Moreover, a language model based on topic model is integrated into proposed speech recognition method. This method enables to seek a word sequence as well as a situation sequence and a topic sequence. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach improved the word accuracy, F-measure of keyword and structuring correct rate.
