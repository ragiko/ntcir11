Decision tree-based simultaneous clustering of phonetic contexts, dimensions, and state positions for acoustic modeling.
ABSTRACT In this paper, a new decision tree-based clustering technique called Phonetic, Dimensional and State Positional Decision Tree (PDS-DT) is proposed. In PDS-DT, phonetic contexts, di- mensions and state positions are grouped simultaneously during decision tree construction. PDS-DT provides a complicate dis- tribution sharing structure without any external control parame- ters. In speaker-independent continuous speech recognition ex- periments, PDS-DT achieved about 13%-15% error reduction over the phonetic decision tree-based state-tying technique.
