The purpose of this paper is to analyze some errors of speech recognition and propose anapproach to correct them using rules automatically captured without any correct/incorrectdecisions. We noted the lists of morphemes and calculated their plausibility as a nonsentense collected from various corpora. As a result of experimental evaluation, we found over new 100 rules, which increased accuracies of our experiment. Therefore, we came to the conclusion that our approach is effective.
