In order to clarify the current structure in the Kuroshio front region, intensive ADCP(acoustic Doppler current profiler)surveys were carried out in the shelf and the shelf break region of the East China Sea in May l998 and May l999. To obtain residual currents excluding tidal period fluctuations, harmonic constants ere estimated using the observed ADCP data. Then the variation of the structure of residual currents in the Kuroshio front region is carefully discussed.
