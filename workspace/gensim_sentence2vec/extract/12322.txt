An questionnaire survey was made on children from 6 to 12 years of age (452 males and 414 females) so as to elucidate the tendency of the preference for sweetness, sourness, saltiness and bitterness comparing with that of persons aged from 3 to 79 (991 males and l,027 females). Recognition thresholds for sweetness, sourness and saltiness were measured by using aqueous solutions of sucrose, citric acid and sodium chloride, respectively. The mean values of taste preference and threshold (recognition) were assesed by using Hayashi's quantification method III and Duncan's multiple range test. There was little difference of taste preference in children according to age and sex groupes. The pattern of taste preference on children was similar to that of children-preschool and young-aged persons, but was different from that of middle-aged and aged persons. Children had a tendency to prefer sweet, sour and salty foods such as icecream, the grapefruit, potato chips. Children perceived 0.2-0.8% of sucrose, 0.02-0.08% of citric acid and 0.04-0.16% of sodium chloride in taste threshold. Taste sensitivity of children was slightly lower than that of 20-year-old females, and was similar to that of children-preschool
