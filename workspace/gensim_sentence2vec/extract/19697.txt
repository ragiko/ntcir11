Salesforce offers two types     of certificates:Self-signedA self-signed certificate is signed by Salesforce. Not all external websites accept        self-signed certificates.CA-signedA CA-signed certificate is signed by an external certificate authority (CA). Most external        websites accept CA-signed certificates. You must first generate the certificate signing        request to send to a CA, and then import the signed version of the certificate before you can        use it.

From Setup, click Security Controls | Certificate and Key Management.Select either Create Self-Signed Certificate or Create CA-Signed Certificate, based on what kind of certificate your external website accepts. You cant change the type of a certificate after youve created it.Enter a descriptive label for the Salesforce certificate. This name is used primarily by administrators when viewing certificates.Enter the Unique Name. This name is automatically populated based on the certificate label you enter. This name can contain only underscores and alphanumeric characters, and must be unique in your organization. It must begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores. Use the Unique Name when referring to the certificate using the Force.com Web services API or Apex.Select a Key Size for your generated certificate and keys. We recommend that you use the default key size of 2048 for security reasons. Selecting 2048 generates a certificate using 2048-bit keys and is valid for two years. Selecting 1024 generates a certificate using 1024-bit keys and is valid for one year.
