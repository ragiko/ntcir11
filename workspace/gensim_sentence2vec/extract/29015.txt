A simple procedure for assigning the absolute configuration of two secondary hydroxyl groups located at the C-3 and C-n positions of 1,3,5,…,n-polyols (n=odd number) is presented. The most preferred conformation of benzoylated acyclic 1,3-polyols in solution is considered to adopt the fully extended zigzag carbon-carbon skeleton, and the following general rule has been widely accepted: the exciton coupling CD curves derived from benzoylated 1,3-polyols consist simply of two characteristic shapes, either a distinctive negative or positive couplet if the polyol contains odd number of 1,3-anti-moieties or a very weak CD if an even number of 1,3-anti and/or 1,3-syn moieties are present. Based on these general rules, we analyzed the CD spectra of four isomers of 1,3,5-triol 5, four isomers of 1,3,5,7-tetrol 8, eight isomers of 1,3,5,7,9-pentol 9, and eight isomers of 1,3,5,7,9,11-hexol 10 and the following predictable general trend was observed. 1) A positive CD Cotton effect is correlated to the α-configuration at n-position of 1,3,5,…,n-polyols (n=odd number), while a negative CD to β-configuration at n-position, when the structure of the polyol is depicted as Fig.1. 2) The amplitude (A value) of the Cotton effect is diagnostic for the relative stereochemistry between C-3 and C-n positions: all 3,n-anti isomers gave rise to a stronger coupling with |A|>14, whereas for the 3,n-syn isomers, weaker couplings were observed and the values are |A|<12. The general trend observed provides a unique and simple method for directly determining the absolute configurations of the C-3 and C-n positions of acyclic 1,3-polyols containing a primary hydroxyl group.
