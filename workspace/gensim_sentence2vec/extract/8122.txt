ABSTRACT A method of real time stress analysis by a scanning infrared camera has been developed. The stress concentrations have been measured for the notched and cracked specimens made of aluminium alloy and mild steel. A macroscopic pattern of the stress distribution can be visualized momentarily according to the variation of the applied load. Data of the stress distribution can be stored in a video tape recorder, and accuracy has been improved by smoothing these data. Results are in good agreement with those by the finite element analysis. By means of this system, fatigue crack propagation can be monitored and the hysteresis energy in the cyclic plastic zone at the crack tip can be measured as well. 赤外線映像装置サーマルビデオシステム(TVS)を用いてリアルタイムで応力を測定するシステムの開発を行った.
