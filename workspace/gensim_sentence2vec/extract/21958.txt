OG13-CR-118 It is true of both men and women that those who marry as young adults live longer than those who never marry. This does not show that marriage causes people to live longer, since, as compared with other people of the same age, young adults who are about to get married have fewer of the unhealthy habits that can cause a person to have a shorter life, most notably smoking and immoderate drinking of alcohol.
Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument above?
(A) Marriage trends to cause people to engage less regularly in sports that involve risk of bodily harm.
(B) A married person who has an unhealthy habit is more likely to give up that habit than a person with the same habit who is unmarried.
(C) A person who smoke is much more likely than a nonsmoker to marry a person who smokes at the time of marriage, and the same is true for people who drink alcohol.
(D) Among people who marry as young adults, most of those who give up an unhealthy habit after marriage do not resume the habit later in life
(E) Among people who as young adults neither drink alcohol immoderately nor smoke, those who never marry live as long as those who marry.
不明白为什么选E。
OG解析中,把年轻群组的长寿与否不一定与婚姻有关作为结论,为什么结论是这个?
另外OG解析道将要结婚的人将比不结婚的人更倾向于健康的生活方式。更长寿群体倾向于早婚,仍能推断婚姻能增强人的长寿。因此,只要展示一个年轻就结婚的人趋跟那些拥有同样健康风格但不结婚的年轻人同样长寿,这个就能增强本文结论。这个因此为什么能这样推导出来?
请各位大牛帮忙解答,非常感谢!
