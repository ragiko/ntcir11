ABSTRACT For the most students who begin to learn German as a second foreign language at any universities, it is very difficult to understand and learn a so-called 'Case-System of German', because it seems to be apparently very complexive. Indeed it is not so easy to acquisit such kind of 'case system' especially for the students who have already begun to learn English since their junior high school days. Because a case system as a morphology in English has vanished for thousand years ago. Therefore German seems to be a quite different language from English. But German is not only the case which possesses a complexive case system as a grammatical structure. In this sense, it is very important for teaching German, not only how to motivate students, but also to develop a method for language teaching. This paper is a kind of case study or 'recipe' for the students to get over 'Case-Allergy' somehow. Such a case is sometimes very serious. So I devote this paper to all German lecturers who are suffering in a classroom with so many students. My method is also based upon a linguistic typological theory and the Case Grammar.
