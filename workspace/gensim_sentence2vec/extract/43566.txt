話者が音声に感情を込める際,言葉の意味に含まれる感情からどのような影響を受けているのかを検討した.被験者にとって未知の言語を用いて認知実験を行った.被験者は日本人大学生18名で,刺激は外国語(スウェーデン語,ポルトガル語,ロシア語,ウクライナ語)を母語とする外国人俳優がそれぞれの母語で発話した感情音声であった.感情の同定成績と確信度を感情表出の困難さの指標とした.その際,音声に込める感情と言葉の意味に含まれる感情が同じ場合(一致条件)と異なる場合(不一致条件)を設けた.両条件から得られた実験結果を比較したところ,不一致条件では同定成績が低下することが認められた.結果より,言葉の意味に含まれる感情に影響されて,話者は感情表出が十分に行えなかったことが示唆された.
We evaluated the influence of emotion included in the meaning of speech on vocal expression of emotion.  A recognition test was conducted using foreign languages unknown to participants. The participants were 18 Japanese undergraduate and graduate students.  The emotional voices were spoken by professional foreign actors whose native languages were Swedish, Russian, Ukrainian and Portuguese.  The degree of elaborate expression of vocal emotion was measured by identification performance of emotion and level of confidence.  Two conditions were prepared.  One condition was the "congruent condition," where the emotion expressed by speakers and the emotion included in the meaning of their speech were the same.  The other was the "incongruent condition," where the two emotions were different.  Comparison of the results from both conditions revealed that identification of emotion worsened in the incongruent condition.  These results suggest that the speakers were unable to perform expression of emotion sufficiently under the influence of the emotion included in the meaning of words.
