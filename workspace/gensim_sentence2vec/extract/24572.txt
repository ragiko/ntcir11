【Objective】Different characteristics are found between adult and pediatric recipients of liver transplantation. However, a detailed nationwide database of pediatric liver transplantations has not been fully elucidated in Japan. Therefore it is necessary to accumulate such a nationwide registry of data on pediatric liver transplants. The primary objective of the database is to characterize the trends in indications, outcomes, and developments in pediatric liver transplantations in Japan.【Methods】In 2013, the on-line registration system was opened at several Japanese pediatric liver transplantation centers in Japan. This registry is designed to collect data online, and the subjects will be donors and recipients aged less than 18 years at the time of transplantation. The composition of this registry is classified into 3 categories, and 436 items.【Results】We added some evaluation items of growth and development to LITRE-J (Liver Transplantation REgistry in Japan). We will collect prospective data on children receiving liver transplantations at the pediatric liver transplant centers in Japan and accumulate comprehensive data on pre-and posttransplant outcomes of pediatric liver transplantations.【Conclusion】That the data accumulated by this registration system are expected to serve as basic histories and statistics data for the evaluation and development of pediatric liver transplantations in Japan, such as improvements in results by standardized medical treatment through decisions of the guidelines.
