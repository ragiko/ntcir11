15.1 What is Regression?
Regression is most often used by scientists and engineers to visualize and plot the curve that best describes the shape and behavior of their data. 
Regression procedures find an association between independent and dependent variables that, when graphed on a Cartesian coordinate system, produces a straight line, plane or curve. This is also commonly known as curve fitting. 
The independent variables are the known, or predictor, variables. These are most often your X-axis values. When the independent variables are varied, they result in corresponding values for the dependent, or response, variables, most often assigned to the Y-axis. 
Regression finds the equation that most closely describes, or fits, the actual data, using the values of one or more independent variables to predict the value of a dependent variable. The resulting equation can then be plotted over the original data to produce a curve that fits the data.
