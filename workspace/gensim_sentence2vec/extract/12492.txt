The validity of six k-ε models was investigated by comparing the results of each model for the fully developed turbulent channel flow to the results of the direct numerical simulation(DNS) by Kim, Moin and Moser (1987). Most models show good agreement with DNS for the mean velocity profile, while they have disagreements for the profile of the turbulence energy k. The near-wall behavior of the viscous diffusion term and dissipation term in every model except Kasagi's model have a qualitative discrepancy from the DNS results. The failure in the prediction of the k profile may be due to this fact. The pressure-turbulence diffusion terms in k and ε equations are inconsistent with the near-wall behavior which are derived theoretically. A new model is presented which modifies the pressure-turbulence duffusion term and these defects are reduced to more closely satisfy the theoretical behavior. These modifications revise the behavior of the viscous diffusion term and dissipation term to give better agreement with the DNS results. In addition, these modifications effect the heat transfer calculation, especially for high Prandtl number fluids.
