日本語の母音の無声化について,どのような音声環境が影響を与えるかを検討するために,人工語を日本語話者に発話させて音声分析を行った。その結果,1:母音が/i/であるか/u/であるかは,無声化にほとんど影響しない2:母音が摩擦音/s/に挟まれると無声化が生起しにくくなる3:母音に/s/が先行し/k/が後続する場合は,無声化が極めて生起しやすい4:無声化モーラに後続するモーラの母音が広いと無声化が生起しやすくなる5:無声化はアクセントに影響を与えて,アクセント核を移動させやすい。6:以上の結果のうち2と4は実在語についてもあてはまるということが実験音声学的に確認された。
Japanese vowel devoicing is a well known phenomenon in which a high vowel (commonly/i/and/u/) is articulated without vocal cord vibration. In this paper, I illuminate the relationship between phonetic environment and vowel devoicing, by conducting five experiments using artificial words, as well as real words. The results of these experiments are as follows : (i) As to the rate of vowel devoicing, there is no significant difference between/i/and/u/. (ii) The property of the consonant located before or after the vowel strongly affects the devoicing of the vowel. In particular, the rate of vowel devoicing is less than 30% when fricatives surround the vowel. This tendency is seen in both real and artificial words. (iii) As some researchers have pointed out, the vowel quality belonging to the following mora also affects vowel devoicing. When the vowel is open (/a/), the vowel belonging to the previous mora is more easily devoiced. (iv) In previous studies, it has been pointed out that there is an interaction between devoicing and the location of the accent nucleus. The results of the experiment confirm that devoicing is avoided in vowels in the accent nucleus, and devoicing tends to move the location of accent nucleus.
