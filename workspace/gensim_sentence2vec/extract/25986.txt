Color-associations of 49 words and 30 words, were investigated by 237 and 81 undergraduate students. Two lists of those words were respectively consisted of five sets of nouns that were preselected in terms of red-, blue-, green-, and yellowassociation and colorless-association.  Four words in both red and yellow, and a word in both blue and green are more than the association-ratio of 95%. There are 34 words with color-association of more than 60% association- ratio in the first investigation, and 15 words with colorless-association of more than 60% ratio in the second investigation. Those words may construct a norm of the color-association. A further systematic investigation, however, wil1 be necessary to make a sure norm of the color-association.
