Because of their abundance and simplicity, planes are used in several computer vision tasks such as self-calibration, reconstruction, visual measurement, and obstacle detection. We present a multiple-plane detection algorithm based on homography and projected line detection for use in an uncalibrated projector-camera system. Detection of the projected line from dense corresponding points roughly segments a camera image into multiple planar regions. The homography is calculated using the robust estimator in each plane and outliers are recursively segmented into new planar regions. Lastly, coplanar regions are integrated using re-porjection errors in the recovered planar homographies. Results with real images are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
