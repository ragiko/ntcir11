Generally speaking, spoken monologue sentences are longer and more complex than spoken
dialogue sentences. To achieve high parsing performance for spoken monologue, it could
prove effective to simplify the structure by dividing a sentence into suitable language units.
This paper proposes a method for dependency parsing of Japanese monologue based on
sentence segmentation. In this method, dependency parsing is executed in two stages: a
clause level and a sentence level. An experiment using a spoken monologue corpus shows the
method to be effective for efficient dependency parsing of Japanese monologue sentences.
