The calibration for the traceability of acceleration has long been based on the measurement shown in the ISO standards using a one-axis accelerometer, a one-axis vibration table and a laser interferometer. However there has been no description on multi-axis accelerometers in the ISO standards. On the other hand, the application of multi-axis MEMS accelerometers and gyros has become remarkable these days. This paper discusses the mathematical derivation of the matrix sensitivity very precisely. Three kinds of acceleration vector spaces are introduced. The relationship between the number of axis of the sensors and the dimension of the calibration acceleration vector space is discussed. New classification of cross sensitivity is introduced. The concept of the matrix sensitivity derived by sinusoidal inputs is expanded to the shock input where every component of the sensitivity matrix is expressed by a transfer function. The simple numerical example shows how large the influence of cross sensitivity is in the multi-axis accelerometers. New classification of accelerometers is proposed in terms of the sensitivity. The limit of the conventional calibration technique is shown.
