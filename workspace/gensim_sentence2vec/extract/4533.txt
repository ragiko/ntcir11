Strucuturation theory deals with relation between individual action (agency) and social structure. Giddens objects to the lack of temporality in traditional strucuturalism. From the aggregate perspective of how social forms and institutions are produced and reproduced, the lack of a time-space framework has been detrimental to deeper analysis of central problems in social theory and human practice. Structure consists of rules and resources enabling reproduction of activities of next generation. Giddens looks upon structure which is perpetuated and modified as a result of human agency. In time-geography, human agency must be seen contextually as a continuous flow of conduct situated in time and space, yet with the places of activity resulting from institutions (home, work and school etc.) which reflect structure. Time-geography outlines some components of historically specific, non-fragmented contextual theory of human action stressing practical reason and concrete interaction in time and space. This is part of an argument for a reconstructed new regional geography, building on the traditional, but having theoretical and emancipatory aims. The interest of time-geography to theory of structuration is surely evident. Time-geography is concerned with the infrastrucutual constraints that shape the routines of everyday life and shares with structurtation theory, an emphasis upon the significance of practical character of daily activities, in circumstances where individuals are co-present with one another, for constitution of social conduct.
