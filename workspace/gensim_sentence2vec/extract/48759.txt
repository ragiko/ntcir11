The purpose of this paper is the development of history learning model based on "Bicultural Integration Learning type of 'Cultural Formation' " for foreign school children. At first I refer to the problems when they learn in social studies class, and I show the neediness of "Bicultural Integration Learning type of 'Cultural Formation' " which aim at shaping the bicultural identity. The second, I adopt the theory of Narratological Approach of history (Yoshikawa, 1993). Therefore I took a person on history who conflict between culture and culture. In this paper, I took "Imoko Ono" who were a ambassador which transported a diplomatic correspondence between Japan and China. And Chinese students interpreted to his actions and sentiments. The result of analyses of their narratives, there are some patterns in their narratives. Some of them are shown the narratives like Bicultural. However, perspectives of the others are dominant cultural.
