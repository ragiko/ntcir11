A computer model was developed to establish the relations between 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) parameters such as number of particles and particle size distribution. Computer experiments were performed for both monodispersed and lognormally polydispersed systems. The model is based on distributing a number of spherical grains randomly and without intersection between the grains in a cubic unit. The cubic unit was cut by a random plane and the number of particles which appear in the section and their area fraction were measured. This procedure was repeated so that the average number of particles and the average area fraction become constant. Finally, the 2D size distribution of the particles over all sections was obtained. As a result it was concluded that the volume fraction is equal to the area fraction irrelevant to particle size distribution providing that the total number of measured 2D particles is large enough. As for the number of particles, a relation was deduced to calculate the number of 3D particles in a monodispersed system depending on the number of 2D particles and the volume fraction. On the other hand, in lognormally polydispersed systems the number of 3D particles could be calculated in consideration of the 3D mean and the standard deviation which were estimated from the 2D mean and the standard by a method developed for this propose. Finally, the method was applied on two ductile cast iron specimens and the applicability of the present model was verified.
