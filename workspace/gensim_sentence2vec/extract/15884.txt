There are many factors both from outdoor (For example : natural ventilation etc.) and indoor (For example : human bodies, a hot-water supply equipment, the moisture-conditioning material etc.) which contribute to the indoor humidity environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the contribution of each factor to the indoor climate. In this study, the indoor humidity environment is treated as a linear summation of the contribution from each factor, which can cause an increase or a decrease of humidity to the indoor environment. Then new indices for assessing the contribution of each factor to humidity distribution in a room are proposed as CRI_<(H)> (Contribution Ratio of Indoor Humidity) 1, 2, 3 by means of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation. Moreover, the indices are employed to carry out a 3 months transient simulation in a model living room while moisture-conditioning material is arranged, and also the simulation result is compared with those of a previous uniform model and CFD model of humidity in order to confirm the effectiveness of those indices.
