Abstract: Abstract: In this paper, we propose the system extracting figurative explanations from the web. Our system collects candidates for figurative descriptions for the target words using the Web, and extracts a word that shows to what it should be compared from those candidates. Each extracted word are set as word of comparison in each extraction source candidate. Then, our system selects appropriate candidates by a similarity calculation proposed in this paper, and outputs selected candidate.
