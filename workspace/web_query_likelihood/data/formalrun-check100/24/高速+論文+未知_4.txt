This paper proposes a high-speed state transition control method for the I-PENTAR, which is an inverted pendulum type robot aiming at supporting humans. It is important for an inverted pendulum type robot to control its center of gravity during inverted pendulum control. However, robots aimed at supporting humans must carry loads. This changes the center of gravity of the robot arbitrarily, so these robots need robust control for center of gravity. In this paper, the wheels are controlled by the computed torque method during the standing up and sitting down motion. At the same time, the inclination angle is estimated by the disturbance observer, but control using the observer is performed only during inverted pendulum control. From the result of experiments, it was confirmed that I-PENTAR could realize quick and soft standing up and sitting down motion by the proposed method.
