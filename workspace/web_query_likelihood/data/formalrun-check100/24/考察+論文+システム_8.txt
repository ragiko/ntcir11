In recent years, it seems that the number of parents who complain about their childrens school is increasing seriously.// It is one of the chances of participation in schools to complain to teachers or school board about school education. But, in our country, we dont have a system for transaction of complaints about school education.// In this paper, I take Citizens Ombudsman in Kawasaki as an object of study. Citizens Ombudsman in Kawasaki is a third-party organization managed publicly for transaction of citizens complaints against city administration. I try to view two cases about school education that ombudsman dealt with, and to consider whether complains about school education can be transacted on a system like Citizens Ombudsman in Kawasaki.// As a result of case studies, I argue that the system like Citizens Ombudsman in Kawasaki has the potentiality to inspect actions of teachers, schools, and school board equally, so he can solve complaints about school education not only for relief of petitioners but for reform of administrative institutions.// But I found that it is difficult for the system like Citizens Ombudsman in Kawasaki to judge special and technical decisions made by teachers, schools, and school board. It is assignment to search for the way to control special and technical decisions made by teachers, schools, and school board.
